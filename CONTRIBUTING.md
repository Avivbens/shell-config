# Contributing to shell-config

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `shell-config`! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
1. Clone your forked repository
1. Install dependencies with `npm ci --no-fund --no-audit --no-progress`
1. Make changes
1. Test your changes
1. Submit a pull request against the `beta` branch

## Add Some New Apps / Tools

1. Open the relevant file by the new app category [in here](src/commands/install/config/apps.config.ts)
1. Add the new app / tool to the relevant category, follow the [IAppSetup](src/models/app-setup.model.ts) type
1. Test your changes via the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev -- install
```

4. Commit your changes, like `fix(apps): <Explain>`, and open a PR ðŸŽ‰

## CLI Setup Flow

1. CLI is getting updated via the `shell-config update` command OR installed via the [init.sh](src/scripts/init.sh) script
1. Both the [.zshrc configuration](zsh/.entry-point.sh), and the [UpdateCommand](src/commands/update/update.command.ts) calling `source <(shell-config init-script)` in order to have the dynamic init command of the latest version.
1. The [InitCommand](src/commands/init/init.command.ts) kicks in, and checks all of the relevant files, tools, setups and configurations of the latest version, and update them if needed. Homebrew is been installed for both Apple Silicon and Intel based Macs. It will also backup the current `.zshrc` file
