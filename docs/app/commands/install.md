# Install Command

The `install` command is used to install useful MacOS applications and tools - according to your own profile preferences.

This command will install each of the selected applications and all of its dependencies.

Select the applications you want to install by using the arrow keys and space bar to select/deselect the applications. Press `Enter` to install the selected applications.

## Profiles

You can set predefined selected applications by using the profiles feature. Simply select the relevant profiles you'd like to have, and press `Enter` to preselect relevant applications.

Some profiles have dependencies, such as `node-engineering` profile, which is dependent on the `engineering` profile.
You can select both, but under the hood, the `engineering` profile will be selected automatically.
