# Assets Command

The `assets` command is used to configure your MacOS assets, such as `gitconfig` and `npmrc`.

## Usage

```bash
shell-config assets
```

Select and customize the assets according to your needs, by using the arrow keys and space bar to enter into menus. Press `Enter` to apply the selected assets.

For each selected asset, you'd be asked to provide the required information.

::: warning **Note ‚ùó**
For some configuration, you may be asked to provide your password.
Pay attention to the password inputs if needed! _( üîë - key icon)_

## Multi Profiles Support

Both `gitconfig` and `npmrc` assets support multi profiles.

You can create as many profiles as you wish, and simply switch between them using the `npmrc` NPM package / `swgit` command for `gitprofile`.
